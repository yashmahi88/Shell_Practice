# Practice Exercises - Exit Statuses and Return Codes

## Exercise 1:
Write a shell script that displays "This script will exit with a 0 exit status." Be sure that the script
does indeed exit with a 0 exit status.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "This file will exit with a 0 exit status."

exit 0
```
To check status:

```
echo "$?"
```
## Exercise 2:
Write a shell script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument. Have the script report
if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file. If it is a regular file, exit with a 0 exit status.

If it is a directory, exit with a 1 exit status. If it is some other type of file, exit with a 2 exit status.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ -e $1 ];then
  if [ -d $1 ];then
    exit 1
  elif [ -f $1 ];then
    exit 0
  else
    exit 2
  fi
else
  echo "{$1} file does no exists"
fi

```

```
./exit2.sh exit1.sh
```
To check exit status:
```
echo "$?"
```
## Exercise 3:
Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow". If the command returns a 0 exit
status report "Command succeeded" and exit with a 0 exit status. If the command returns a
nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command failed" and exit with a 1 exit status.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

show=$(cat /etc/shadow/)

if [ "$?" -eq "0" ];then
  echo "Command succeeded"
  exit 0
else
  echo "Command failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

To check exit status:
```
echo "$?"
```
